Titanic Classification Project

A complete end-to-end project using Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. This project demonstrates how to perform:
	•	Data Exploration & Cleaning
	•	Feature Engineering
	•	Model Training (Baseline Decision Tree & Ensemble Models)
	•	Hyperparameter Tuning (Using GridSearchCV)
	•	Evaluation & Comparison (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix)
	•	Interpretability (Feature Importances)

Project Overview

The Titanic Classification Project aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as:
	•	Passenger Class (Pclass)
	•	Sex
	•	Age
	•	Siblings/Spouses Aboard (SibSp)
	•	Parents/Children Aboard (Parch)
	•	Ticket Fare, Embarked Port, etc.

This repository walks through the entire process: from reading the original Titanic dataset to deploying multiple classifiers. By using ensemble methods such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting (including XGBoost), we explore how combining multiple models can often yield higher accuracy and better generalization than a single decision tree.

Dataset

We use the well-known Titanic dataset from Kaggle. In particular, the file train.csv contains both the passenger features and the target variable (Survived).

Data fields (a subset):
	•	Survived - 0 = No, 1 = Yes
	•	Pclass - Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
	•	Name - Name of the passenger
	•	Sex - Male or Female
	•	Age - Age in years
	•	SibSp - # of siblings / spouses aboard
	•	Parch - # of parents / children aboard
	•	Ticket - Ticket number
	•	Fare - Passenger fare
	•	Cabin - Cabin number (highly incomplete)
	•	Embarked - Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

Note: You need to download train.csv (and optionally test.csv if you want to further experiment) from the Kaggle website and place it in the root folder of this repository or in a specified directory.

Requirements
	•	Python 3.7+
	•	pip or conda for installing packages

Python Libraries
	•	pandas (pip install pandas)
	•	numpy (pip install numpy)
	•	scikit-learn (pip install scikit-learn)
	•	matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
	•	seaborn (pip install seaborn)
	•	xgboost (pip install xgboost)
	•	jupyter or jupyterlab (if you want to run the notebook interactively)

Alternatively, you can install everything at once using the requirements.txt (if provided) by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
	1.	Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Titanic-Classification-Project.git
cd Titanic-Classification-Project


	2.	Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

or install the libraries listed in the Requirements section manually.

	3.	Download the Dataset
	•	Go to the Kaggle Titanic competition.
	•	Sign in, download train.csv (and optionally test.csv).
	•	Place them in the repository folder (or the path referenced in the notebook).
	4.	Run the Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook titanic_ensemble_project.ipynb

	•	Open the notebook in your browser and run the cells step-by-step.

	5.	Explore & Experiment
	•	Modify hyperparameters in the GridSearchCV.
	•	Try different feature engineering approaches.
	•	Add or remove columns, or even bring in external data.

Results

Model Performance Comparison

In this project, we train:
	•	Decision Tree Classifier (Baseline + Hyperparameter Tuning)
	•	Random Forest Classifier
	•	Gradient Boosting Classifier
	•	XGBoost Classifier

Typical evaluation metrics reported:
	•	Accuracy
	•	Precision
	•	Recall
	•	F1-score
	•	Confusion Matrix

Often, XGBoost or Gradient Boosting yields higher accuracy than the single decision tree. However, results may vary depending on the hyperparameters and feature engineering steps.

Sample Confusion Matrix (Placeholder)

	Predicted = 0	Predicted = 1
Actual = 0	TN	FP
Actual = 1	FN	TP
